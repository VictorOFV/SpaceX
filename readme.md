# <center>SpaceX - Clone</center>

Welcome to my SpaceX website clone project, developed using SASS and Bootstrap. This project is solely for educational purposes, exploring different approaches across the three pages. 

On the main page, I prioritized Bootstrap with minimal CSS styling. On the Falcon 9 page, I took a balanced approach between styling and Bootstrap. Finally, on the Human Flight page, I focused more on CSS. 

It's worth noting that the project's structure was not optimized for easy maintenance, as the primary goal was to experiment with various ways of building a website using Bootstrap and SASS.## Installation
